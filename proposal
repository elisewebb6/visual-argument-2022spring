For my visual argument project my goal is to downlaod an image of an eyeball and then to fill and color the iris 
with a bunch of my own pictures. The photos will consist of all the places I've traveled collaged togther. I will 
also include short quotes which the eyelashes will consist of. The main goal of this photo will be that we must find our own 
beauty in the world
