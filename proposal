For my visual argument project my goal is to downlaod an image of an eyeball and then to fill and color the iris 
with a bunch of my own pictures. The photos will consist of all the places I've traveled sort of collaged togther. 
The main goal of this photo will be that we must find our own beauty in the world. I will also include a quote of
some sort below the eye.

ASSETS: I plan to use mostly my own photos
